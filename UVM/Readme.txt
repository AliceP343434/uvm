Virtual Master Program version 3.2.

June 2010.

Virtual Master is a program where you can design your own virtual Master or Mistress.

The file User guide.pdf describes how to use the program.
The file Script Writing Manual 3.2.pdf describes how to write your own script.
The file Conversion-Guide.rtf contains some help in converting scripts from version 1 or 2 to version 3.

The files demo-female.ini and demo-male.ini are sample demo scripts that you can use to play with Virtual Master. You can change them to fit your own needs.

This program requires Windows 95 or later. 
If you plan to use the webcam facility, it requires DirectX 9 or later.
The program is only developed and testet on Windows XP. However, I have been told that it works fine on Linux using WINE and on Mac using Parallels. 

Note: This version of Virtual Master will only run scripts designed for version 3. If you want to run scripts designed for version 1 or 2, please use Virtual Master version 2.1.
